# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, an optimization problem that aims to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to multiple locations. The goal is to minimize travel costs while satisfying various constraints such as vehicle capacity, time windows, and delivery demands.

## Features
- Implementation of the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** using Python.
- Uses optimization techniques to find efficient routes.
- Supports multiple constraints like vehicle capacity and distance limitations.
- Visual representation of the routes.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib ortools
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-routing-problem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd vehicle-routing-problem
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Vehicle_Routing_Problem.py.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the VRP algorithm and visualize the results.

## Example Output
The notebook generates optimized routes along with a graphical representation of the solution. It helps to efficiently manage logistics and distribution networks.
